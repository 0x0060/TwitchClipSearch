# Monitoring and Observability

This directory contains documentation for monitoring and observability setup in the TwitchClipSearch application.

## Monitoring Stack

1. Metrics Collection
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Custom application metrics
   - System metrics

2. Logging
   - Structured logging format
   - Log aggregation
   - Log retention policies

3. Alerting
   - Alert rules and thresholds
   - Notification channels
   - On-call rotation

4. Dashboards
   - System overview

   - Error rates and latencies
   - Resource utilization

## Key Metrics

1. Application Metrics
   - Request rates and latencies
   - Error rates and types
   - Cache hit/miss rates
   - Queue lengths and processing times

2. System Metrics
   - CPU usage
   - Memory utilization
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic

3. Business Metrics
   - Clip search volumes
   - User engagement
   - API usage patterns

## Observability Best Practices

1. Instrumentation
   - Use consistent metric naming
   - Add appropriate labels
   - Include relevant dimensions

2. Alert Configuration
   - Set meaningful thresholds
   - Avoid alert fatigue
   - Include runbooks

3. Dashboard Organization
   - Logical grouping of metrics
   - Clear visualization choices
   - Useful time ranges

## Troubleshooting Guide

1. Common Monitoring Issues
   - False positives
   - Missing data
   - Alert storms

2. Resolution Steps
   - Metric verification
   - Log correlation
   - Root cause analysis
